        <p>
            My name is Victoria Gonzalez and I am a web developer based in Orlando, Florida.
            I have a background in the Hotel Management and Business Administration.  
            With technology always changing, what a better way to challenge myself and learn
             new things than by web developing.<br>
            <br>
            I enjoy attending sporting events, and of course rooting for 
            Orlando City SC or Tampa Bay Lightning. 
            Let's not forget homebrewing beer, and traveling the world.<br>
            <br>
            Feel free to check out my Portfolio and see some of my web development work.   
            If you are interested to learn more about me, check out my social media links or 
            contact me by filling up the form on the contact page and I will get back at you!
